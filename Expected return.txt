To calculate Beta:

1. volatility of market, stock
2. Correlation/convariance between market and stock

beta = (volatilityOfStock) * Corr(stock,market) / (volatilityOfMarket) = Cov(stock,market) / (volatilityOfMarket)^2

To calculate the expected return:
1. Risk free return
2. Beta of stock
3. Expected return of market

expectedReturnStock = riskFreeRate + beta * (expectedReturnMarket - riskFreeRate);

expectedReturnPortfolio = sumoff(expectedReturnStock*portfolioWeight)
